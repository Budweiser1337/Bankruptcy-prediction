Welcome to the Taiwanese Companies Bankruptcy Prediction project! 

This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify the likelihood of bankruptcy for Taiwanese companies. 

In a work setting and by leveraging machine learning techniques and financial data, the goal would be to assist stakeholders, such as investors, creditors, and regulatory bodies, in making informed decisions.

As bankruptcy due to business failure can negatively affect the enterprise as well as the global economy, it is crucial to understand and predict whether a company is showing symptoms of going bankrupt or not. The idea is to analyse the distresses in the corporate by taking into considerations different KPIâ€™s of the company. These distresses often lead to bankruptcy of the company if not alerted at the right time. The problem statement is to develop a prediction model which will predict whether a company can go bankrupt or not. This will help the company to take appropriate decisions.
